# Object Detecting and Counting using Yolo V3 weights with OpenCV

This repo contains the implementation of object counting algorithm using yolo and OpenCV. 

# How to run?

Before you run, to obtain predictions using opencv dnn module, you will need to get yolo v3 weights. To get them you can directly run python or ipython notebook or you can use the following link:
```
!wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
```
After you downloaded the weights, you should move them to the models folder.

All required libraries can be found in requirements.txt file. You can easly install required libraries and run python or ipython notebook and detect and count objects in the coco dataset.

Another way to run is using Google Colab link. You don't have to install anything since all the libraries are default installed in colab. You can just use new paths for your video or image files and thats it!
